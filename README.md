# Chord-dht
Distributed Hash Table using Chord protocol

# Downlaod and Import the file
Please import this as Java Maven project. Use Java 11 or newer version to compile. 
<br>The default values for number of points in the Chord is 1000, for number of queries made is 100000, number of entries in the finger table is 24. 
<br>You can make changes in Chord.java to change the default values. 

# How to Run it
The input arguments for Chord.java are number of nodes in the Network, whether you want to read network from the file, if so, the network file name. 
<br>For example, the input arguments can be "6 false" for no network input or "6 true link.dat" for input the links of the network from the link.dat file. 
<br>There will be a link.dat file that records the links between nodes for the network if the input arguments do not read network from file.
